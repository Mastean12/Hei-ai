<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of Hei-AI is to demonstrate the capabilities of AI technologies in providing insights and predictions on various datasets. However, it is important to note that the project is experimental and caution should be exercised when utilizing AI models that have not undergone thorough training and testing.</p>
<p>Hei-AI was created using the open-source GPT architecture, which is widely known for its language modeling capabilities. Specifically, the project uses the Davicii 003 model, which is a variant of the GPT-3 architecture developed by Davicii Labs. The Davicii 003 model has been trained on a large corpus of text and can generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses to a wide range of prompts.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use Hei-AI, simply access the demo using the links provided above. Once you are on the demo page, you can input the dataset you want to analyze and select the AI technology you want to use. The project will then provide insights and predictions based on the dataset and technology you have selected.</p>
